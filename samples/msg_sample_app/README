PCIe dolphin solution test application
____________________________________________________________________________________

a. Introduction
_____________________________________________________

This is a sample application to test PIO and DMA functionality of dolphin solution from ARM to x86 side.

It establishes a channel and sends a message using DMA or PIO as set by MACROS. The TEST macros can be set only on ARM side.

c. MACROS Description
_____________________________________________________

1. TARGET_NODE:
	The dolphin solution's node ID for the target machine.
	The node ID of a dolphin installation can be found by going to /opt/DIS/sbin and running ./dis_status. Look for Local Node ID.
	In our setup, node ID currently for ARM is 8 and x86 is 4.
 
2. TEST_DMA:
	When set, DMA will be tested. Otherwise PIO write is tested from arm to x86 side.
	If DMA_WRITE is also set, DMA write is tested. Else DMA read from the remote side is tested.

3. DMA_WRITE:
	Flag to set DMA direction



d. BUILD
_______________________________________________________

Ensure that all the header files needed for dolphin APIs are available in place.
The folders where necessary header files are kept can be found in EXTRA_FLAGS description in the current make file.
The base folder in current makefile is - /home/ssrg_lab/dolphin/

The above needed header files can be got from the dolphin installation script by getting tarball using the command -

#./script.sh --get-tarball

2. After Makefile is modified, Make the modules using -

#make clean; make

3. Then insert the application modules using -

#insmod sample.ko

4. while testing independently, you can remove module using -

#rmmod sample.ko
